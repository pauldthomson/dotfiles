- remember to always create a branch first when we commit, push, pr
- When using the `gh` CLI tool to create any new resource (issues, pull requests, etc.) that returns a URL, always use pbcopy to copy the URL to the system clipboard. Use separate bash tool calls: first create the resource, then copy the returned URL with a dedicated pbcopy command.
- Whenever you commit, push, pr make sure you're on a new branch up to date with the main branch. If you think the new change is related to an existing PR then check the PR status first (using `gh pr view <number>`) to see if it's still open before deciding whether to add to the existing branch or create a new one.
- always update all relevant documentation (README.md etc) whenver making changes
