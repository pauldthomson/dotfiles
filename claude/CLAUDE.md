- remember to always create a branch first when we commit, push, pr
- When using the `gh` CLI tool to create any new resource (issues, pull requests, etc.) that returns a URL, get the URL directly from the command output and pipe it to pbcopy in a single step. The URL is returned in the gh command response - don't make a separate gh pr view call. IMPORTANT: When piping to pbcopy, the command will show NO output on success (the output goes to clipboard). Don't retry thinking it failed - the lack of output means success.
- Before ANY git operations (add, commit, push, pr), ALWAYS check your current branch status with `git status` and `git branch -vv`. If you're on a feature branch, verify it still exists upstream with `git fetch origin && git branch -r | grep <branch-name>`. If the upstream branch is gone (likely merged), switch to main with `git checkout main && git pull origin main` and create a fresh feature branch. If you think the new change is related to an existing PR then check the PR status first (using `gh pr view <number>`) to see if it's still open before deciding whether to add to the existing branch or create a new one.
- always update all relevant documentation (README.md etc) whenver making changes
- Make sure commit messages/PR descriptions include why we made the change and not just what was changed. If you're unclear about what the "why" part was, don't make something up and just ask me
- don't include test plan in PR descriptions
- Always use `go mod tidy` instead of manually editing go.mod. It properly resolves transitive dependencies, updates go.sum with correct checksums, and prevents build failures. Run it after making code changes that add/remove imports, or when switching between package versions (e.g., HTTP â†’ gRPC exporters).
